## 1. MARKET RESEARCH

### Target Buyer
- **Primary persona:** Individual contributor just promoted to manager (or about to be). Ages 28–42. Typically in tech, operations, marketing, or professional services. No formal management training.
- **Trigger moment:** They just got promoted, they're starting a new role with direct reports in 1–4 weeks, or they're 2 weeks in and already feeling lost.
- **Buyer mindset:** Anxious, eager to do well, searching for a shortcut to competence. Feels imposter syndrome. Wants a system, not theory.
- **Willingness to pay:** Personal money — this is a self-investment purchase. $15–$39 is an impulse buy for this audience. Some may expense it.

### Search Demand
- **Primary keywords:** "new manager checklist", "first time manager guide", "90 day plan new manager", "new manager training template", "first time manager tips"
- **Long-tail keywords:** "what to do first week as new manager", "new manager 30 60 90 day plan template", "how to run first one on one as manager", "first time manager mistakes to avoid", "new manager conversation scripts", "how to give feedback as a new manager", "first time manager toolkit PDF", "new manager onboarding checklist printable"
- **Monthly search volume estimate:** High — "new manager" cluster gets 10k-50k+ monthly searches across variants
- **Search intent:** Mixed informational/transactional — people searching for templates and toolkits have purchase intent

### Competitive Landscape
- **Direct competitors:**
  1. Gumroad "Manager's 30-60-90 Day Plan" (Notion template) — $15-$25
  2. Etsy "New Manager Training Kit: 90-day Leadership Bundle" (PPT/Canva/Ebook) — €29-€49
  3. Etsy various "30 60 90 day plan templates" (PowerPoint/Word) — $5-$15
  4. Kommon "New Manager Playbook" training resources — $475 (enterprise)
  5. Free lead magnets: BizLibrary, People Managing People, DeVry guides (low quality, gated behind email capture)
- **Competitor weaknesses:**
  - Notion templates require Notion knowledge and a Notion account
  - Etsy PowerPoint templates are just slide decks — no actual guidance content
  - Enterprise solutions ($475+) are overkill for individual managers
  - Free guides are generic theory with no actionable tools
  - Almost nobody offers word-for-word conversation scripts
  - Nobody combines frameworks + worksheets + scripts + checklists in one PDF
- **Our angle:** The only print-ready, self-contained PDF kit that combines actual management frameworks with fillable worksheets, word-for-word scripts, and day-by-day action plans. No app required. No account needed. Works offline. Print it and go.
- **Price positioning:** Mid-range at $29. More valuable than $5 Etsy templates (which are just blank slides), cheaper than enterprise training. Perceived value of $75+ based on depth.
